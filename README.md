Hey!

Thanks for coming to check out my repository following along with this course. 

I decided to take this course (it was a no-brainer, it's a brilliant course) to give some structure to my learning and to help advance my education. 

This repository is following me along the bootcamp, as I complete lessons and excercises. You can track as I improve with each lesson, getting gradually more advanced.

Once I have completed the course, I will be making another repository specifically for the Projects to be seperate.

 Starts from 2.1

 11-14 : Mostly studying beginner JavaScript, and doing minor excercises that are not worth uploading as they're only few lines of code.

The course is "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=LEADERSALE24B". Cannot recommend enough, and I've only just began.

- Cory.
