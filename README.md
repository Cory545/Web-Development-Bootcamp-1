Hey!

Thanks for coming to check out this specific repository. 

Although I'm dedicated, I lack alot of structure. This is why I decided to go with a bootcamp. Web Development is a massive passion for me, and I am obsessed. I seek employment in the future, but for now I improve - and will never stop improving.

This repository is following me along the bootcamp, as I complete lessons and excercises. I will be making larger projects in here also that combine with this bootcamp. 

- Cory.
