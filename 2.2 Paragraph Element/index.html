<p>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

    Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.
    
    I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. You don't believe in the Force, do you? As you wish. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
    
    She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?
    
    I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Don't underestimate the Force. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!
    
    The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>

<p>Don't underestimate the Force. He is here. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

    I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
    
    Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? What!? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
    
    Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. He is here. Red Five standing by. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
    
    He is here. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.
    
    I'm trying not to, kid. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.
    
    I find your lack of faith disturbing. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.
    
    What!? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. You mean it controls your actions? I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
    
    I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?
    
    Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. You don't believe in the Force, do you? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? As you wish. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
    
    Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
    
    Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. You mean it controls your actions? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</p>

<p>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

    I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Don't underestimate the Force. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

    You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. He is here. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
    
    Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.
